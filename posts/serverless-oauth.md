# Intro

<small>Before we start, you can view the entire code [here](https://github.com/alii/nextjs-discord-oauth)</small>

Since the early days of man, OAuth has always been a struggle for new developers. In the stone age, we struggled with three things: starting fires, finding food, and figuring out why our OAuth scopes weren't working. Well explorer, look no further. Today, we'll be going through the process of connecting & deploying Discord's OAuth 2 API with Next.js and serverless [now functions](https://vercel.com/docs/serverless-functions/introduction)

---

## The setup

Firstly, we're going to need to create a Next.js app. Feel free to _skip_ this if you "have one that you made earlier."

### Initialise project

```shell
yarn create next-app my-app
```

or, if you use npm (although use of yarn is **strongly** recommended)

```shell
npx create-next-app my-app
```

### Add TypeScript

Next (no pun intended) we need to add and configure TypeScript.

```shell
cd my-app
touch tsconfig.json
yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react --dev
```

After this, you must rename every file in the project to end in `.tsx` for apps with JSX, and `.ts` for apps without.

At this point, we can start our app

If you open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser you will see the welcome to Next.js page â€“ if so, we can confirm that your Next.js setup is all working.

### Adding dependencies

We're going to use `jsonwebtoken` for generating the users' tokens, `cookie` for serializing & parsing cookies and `node-fetch` for making our requests to the Discord API. Install them like this

```shell
yarn add node-fetch jsonwebtoken cookie && yarn add @types/node-fetch @types/jsonwebtoken @types/cookie --dev
```

After this, you're going to want to make a director under the `pages` called `api`. In this `api` folder, make a new file called `oauth.ts`. This is where we will add the code for OAuth.

### The code

```typescript
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
import fetch from "node-fetch";
import cookie from "cookie";

// Create our type definition for a Discord User
interface DiscordUser {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  avatar: string;
  discriminator: string;
  public_flags: number;
  flags: number;
  locale: string;
  mfa_enabled: boolean;
  premium_type: number;
}

// Extract environment variables from process.env
// (we will come on to this later)
const {
  CLIENT_SECRET,
  CLIENT_ID,
  APP_URI,
  JWT_SECRET,
  COOKIE_NAME,
} = process.env;

// Create scopes, oauth querystring and URIs
const scope = ["identify"].join(" ");
const REDIRECT_URI = `${APP_URI}/api/oauth`;

const OAUTH_QS = new URLSearchParams({
  client_id: CLIENT_ID || "0",
  redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI,
  response_type: "code",
  scope,
}).toString();

const OAUTH_URI = `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?${OAUTH_QS}`;

export default async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  if (req.method !== "GET") return res.redirect("/");

  // Find the code or error from the request querystring
  const { code = null, error = null } = req.query;

  // If there is an error, redirect to the index page
  if (error) {
    return res.redirect("/?error=oauth");
  }

  // If there is no code, redirect to the OAuth URI
  if (!code || typeof code !== "string") return res.redirect(OAUTH_URI);

  const body = new URLSearchParams({
    client_id: CLIENT_ID!,
    client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET!,
    grant_type: "authorization_code",
    redirect_uri: REDIRECT_URI,
    code,
    scope,
  }).toString();

  // Request our access token, defaulting it to null if something goes wrong
  const { access_token = null } = await fetch(
    "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token",
    {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
      method: "POST",
      body,
    }
  ).then((res) => res.json());

  // If the access token does not exist, return
  if (!access_token || typeof access_token !== "string") {
    return res.redirect(OAUTH_URI);
  }

  // Fetch this current user (uses the "identify" scope)
  const me: DiscordUser | { unauthorized: true } = await fetch(
    "http://discord.com/api/users/@me",
    {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}` },
    }
  ).then((res) => res.json());

  // If the id does not exist in the response body, request reauthorization
  if (!("id" in me)) {
    return res.redirect(OAUTH_URI);
  }

  // Sign a JWT with the payload of the current user...
  const token = jwt.sign(me, JWT_SECRET!, { expiresIn: "24h" });

  // ...and set it as a header
  res.setHeader(
    "Set-Cookie",
    cookie.serialize(COOKIE_NAME!, token, {
      httpOnly: true,
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "development",
      sameSite: "lax",
      path: "/",
    })
  );

  // Redirect back to the homepage
  res.redirect("/");
};
```

There's a bit more to do, but the main setup of our oauth endpoint is finished. It's really not too much to swallow ðŸ˜…

### Environment

###### No... I'm not talking about the weather...

Next up, we must configure our environment variables. Head over to [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) & create a new application (or use one if you already have it).

You'll want to save the `CLIENT ID` and `CLIENT SECRET` somewhere safe, as seen in the screenshot below.

![A screenshot of the Discord Client ID and Client Secret on the dashboard](/assets/images/discord-applications.png)

After this, create a file in the root directory of your project called `.env`. This is where we will store our secrets (sensitive information that shouldn't be hardcoded). Add in the following content to `.env`:

```dotenv
CLIENT_ID=<the client id you copied>
CLIENT_SECRET=<the client secret you copied>
APP_URI=http://localhost:3000
JWT_SECRET=development-only-jwt-secret-value-change-me-in-prod!
COOKIE_NAME=token
```

Eventually, we will **change** `APP_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`, so don't save them anywhere for now.

Now, if you rerun the app with `yarn dev` and head to [localhost:3000/api/oauth](http://localhost:3000/api/oauth) you should be redirected to the OAuth URI. However, you may see an issue regarding an invalid Redirect URI. To resolve this, head to "OAuth2" under the sidebar (as seen below):

![A screenshot of the Discord developer dashboard sidebar](/assets/images/discord-oauth-panel.png)

Add `http://localhost:3000/api/oauth` as an entry for usable Redirect URIs.

### Displaying the user's details

Our last step is to display the user's details in the app. If you head to `pages/index.tsx`, add the following code

```typescript
import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";
import { parseUser } from "../utils/parse-user";

interface DiscordUser {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  avatar: string;
  discriminator: string;
  public_flags: number;
  flags: number;
  locale: string;
  mfa_enabled: boolean;
  premium_type: number;
}

type Props = { user: DiscordUser | null };

export default function Index(props: Props) {
  if (!props.user) {
    return <p>You are being redirected.</p>;
  }

  return (
    <h1>
      Hey, {props.user.username}#{props.user.discriminator}
    </h1>
  );
}

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps<Props> = async function (
  ctx
) {
  // Use our parseUser function (defined in the next steps)
  const user = parseUser(ctx);

  // If the user is null, return 307 (redirect)
  if (!user) {
    ctx.res.statusCode = 307;
    // ...to the /api/oauth endpoint
    ctx.res.setHeader("Location", "/api/oauth");
    // ...and end the request early
    ctx.res.end();
  }

  // return our props of a nullish user
  return { props: { user } };
};
```

...and create a file under a new directory called `utils` with the name of `parse-user.ts`. Add the following code:

```ts
import { GetServerSidePropsContext } from "next";
import { parse } from "cookie";
import { verify } from "jsonwebtoken";

// Get our environment variables
const { JWT_SECRET, COOKIE_NAME } = process.env;

interface DiscordUser {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  avatar: string;
  discriminator: string;
  public_flags: number;
  flags: number;
  locale: string;
  mfa_enabled: boolean;
  premium_type: number;
}

export function parseUser(ctx: GetServerSidePropsContext): DiscordUser | null {
  // Check if the cookie exists, if not return null
  if (!ctx.req.headers.cookie) {
    return null;
  }

  // Parse the token from headers
  const token = parse(ctx.req.headers.cookie)[COOKIE_NAME!];

  // If there is no token, return null
  if (!token) {
    return null;
  }

  // Try parsing the JWT (this can throw errors, hence the try/catch block)
  try {
    const { iat, exp, ...user } = verify(token, JWT_SECRET!) as DiscordUser & {
      iat: number;
      exp: number;
    };

    // Return the user
    return user;
  } catch (e) {
    // Something went wrong. Likely being an invalid signature sent by the client
    return null;
  }
}
```

### Almost there

Our last thing to do is to deploy our app to vercel. Firstly, ensure that you have vercel CLI installed

```shell
yarn global add vercel
vercel login
```

After this, run `git init` to ensure that you have initiated a local git repository here. Create a repo on GitHub and then run

```shell
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name
```

To connect the repo to your GitHub remote.

Lastly, we need to deploy the app on Vercel. Open the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and hit "import project"

![Vercel import project button screenshot](/assets/images/vercel-import.png)

Choose "Import Git Repository" and enter the URL of the repo you just made on GitHub. Next, under environment settings, you need to add the same variables we defined in our local `.env`. **However**, you must set `JWT_SECRET` to a cryptographically secure, randomly generated string. I would recommend [this website](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) as a good start.

##### Hey! What about `APP_URI`?!

Great question! Since this is our production deployment and we are not running on `localhost`, we must set this to the URL that our app will be readily available on. If your project name is `my-new-app`, for example, then `APP_URI` could be `https://my-new-app.vercel.app`. If you are using a custom domain, then it would be that domain (with https).

Finally, with this all together, you can run your app and do the full OAuth flow. If you have any questions, pm me on discord **alistair#9999** or email me at hey@alistair.cloud. I'll try and reply as quickly as possible.

### Next steps

1. Extract `DiscordUser` to a seperate file called `types.ts` (under `util` would make sense), so we are not repeating ourselves (this is done in the repo).
2. Make coffee.
